# Blood-Group-Detection-using-Fingerprint-via-Deep-Learning-
This project explores the use of **deep learning** techniques to detect blood groups non-invasively from fingerprint images.
It combines **minutiae-based image processing** and other image processing techniques like Grayscale Conversion, Denoising, Sharpening, and Adaptive Threshoding with CNN architectures like **VGG16** and **Custom ResNet**, delivering high accuracy while offering a real-world alternative to traditional blood sampling.

# Tech Stack

- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy  
- **Deep Learning Models:** VGG16, Custom ResNet  
- **Frontend:** Material UI, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Tools:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
